	Note that only the root and children (children, grand children, grand grand children â€¦. and all) 
	should have different colors. 
	The root of the tree can choose any of the K colors so K ways. 
	Every other node can choose other K-1 colors other than its parent. 
	So every node has K-1 choices.
	Here, we select the tree as every node as only one child. 
	We can choose any of the K colors for the root of the tree so K ways. 
	And we are left with K-1 colors for its child. So for every child we can assign a color 
	other than its parent. Thus, for each of the N-1 nodes we are left with K-1 colors. 
	Thus the answer is K*(K-1)^(N-1).

	// K*(K-1)^(N-1) its "and" operation
